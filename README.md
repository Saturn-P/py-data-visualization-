| Title | Author | Objective | Limitations |
|-------|--------|-----------|-------------|
| SiNER: A Large Dataset for Sindhi Named Entity Recognition | Wazir Ali, Junyu Lu, Zenglin Xu | Build SiNER dataset (1.35M tokens) with CRF and Bi-LSTM-CRF baselines (89.16% F1-score) | Limited to Perso-Arabic script; polysemy issues; no transformer models |
| Sindhi Named Entity Recognition (SNER) | Hakro et al., 2024 | Develop rule-based SNER with 97% accuracy on 200,000 tokens | Not open-source; uses accuracy, not F1-score; small corpus; no neural models |
| Context-Aware Bidirectional Neural Model for Sindhi Named Entity Recognition | Ali et al., 2021 | Propose CaBiLSTM model on SiNER (91.25% F1-score), compare with BiLSTM-CRF | No transformers; limited to SiNERâ€™s tags; polysemy challenges |
